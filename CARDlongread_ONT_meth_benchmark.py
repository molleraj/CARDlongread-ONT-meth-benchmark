# CARDlongread_ONT_meth_benchmark.py
# full methylation benchmark based on https://github.com/NIH-CARD/CARDlongread_meth_R.9vs10
# takes multiple ONT methylBeds and/or corresponding bisulfite methylation as inputs
# import needed libraries
import pandas as pd
# possibly switch to polars for speed/memory efficiency improvements
